This file is going to be a quick overview of what I learned from making the projects in this beginning period of my learning.

tellingtime: 
    -This taught me about how Python formats its print statements, specifically around using commas to include variable values
    as well as the ability of using " or ' for strings and how they nest inside eachother.
    -It also taught me about taking input from the terminal
    -This was an intro to the isnumeric, isalpha, etc functions which at this time I think are great for categorizing input
    -This was an intro to the name == main thing, and a youtube video telling about how it makes python distinguish between
     the file being ran as is and the file being imported.
    -Taught me about using a while loop to repeatedly run the game until the user quits
guessNumber:
    -Imports, specifically the syntax and how importing * lets you bypass referencing it in commands
    -Introduction to the random package, specifically randint
    -Where I learned what tkinter was but have not learned it
rps:
    -Learned that you can place text inside input() which looks way nicer than having a print statement after
    -Learned about how to format new lines using \n, and that print statements have \n automatically at the end
    -Learned that python greys out text that is impossible to reach, which is very nice
    -Learned about conditionals with multiple conditions at once
    -First attempt at making a list of affirmative answers rather than just polling Y/N from the user to continue, 
     in an attempt to make it more natural. Might be worth importing a list of affirmative words and just iterating it
hangman:
    -First and foremost, first try at using comments, learning that ''' and # both work
    -The value of using multiple functions to keep code looking nice is great
    -Realized that I should have used guard clauses, learned from youtube. Basically just inverting conditionals to keep
     the majority of code outside of a conditional, thereby reducing indents
    -Experience working with strings and lists and manipulating them. Learned about replacing a certain character in a strings
    -Learned about .lower() and .upper() for using string comparisons and .isalpha()
    -Learned that += and =+ are very different and the latter is kind of useless, it shouldnt work Imports
    -Taught me that I shoud learn tkinter soon cause formatting to look nice is a pain in a termianl
palimdrome:
    -Accessing string elements syntax, [ vs ). 
    -"".join can be used to get rid of unwanted characters in conjunction with the is.alnum() family group. 
    -Replace can easily remove whitespace from a string.
    -Learned from the training website that string_name[::-1] produces the string in reverse order! This is very different from
     I went about doing mine in a for loop, but according to them this difference comes down to saving space or not as their
     method uses more space in the creation of a second string. This is sort-of frivolous as strings aren't that big anyway.
    -I used 3 lines of code to get rid of whitespace, to lowercase everything, and to check if it is alphanumeric. I could
     do this in just one line of code using new_str = "".join(c.lower() for c in str if c.isalpha())
